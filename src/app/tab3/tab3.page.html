        Whether it’s a freebie, discount or deal, an attention-grabbing voucher works well for both drawing in new customers and rewarding loyal regulars.

our company has add them to existing leaflet designs by adding a perforated edging, featuring our offer.  Once we offer is in place, hand them out in the streets to encourage recipients to visit our coffee shop. Or, drop them through the surrounding neighbourhood’s letterboxes so they have a reason to visit later.
